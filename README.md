# Line Bridge Simulator

A web-based simulation exploring concepts of percolation theory by randomly placing lines within a boundary until a contiguous path is formed from one side to the other.

## üéØ Project Description

The **Line Bridge Simulator** is an interactive application that demonstrates a 2D percolation problem. The user defines a set of parameters‚Äîspecifically, the permissible range for line **lengths** and **angles**.

The simulation begins by randomly placing lines, one by one, onto a rectangular canvas. Each new line adheres to the user-defined parameters. After each placement, the simulation checks if a "bridge" has been formed. A "bridge" is a continuous, unbroken chain of intersecting lines that connects two opposite sides of a designated area. The user can select the boundary condition, such as **left-to-right** or **top-to-bottom**.

The simulation stops the moment a bridge is successfully formed. The primary output is the total **number of lines** required to achieve this connection. This project is designed with a highly modular architecture to allow different components (e.g., the simulation logic, the rendering engine, the user interface) to be developed and tested independently and in parallel.

## ‚ú® Core Features

  * **Boundary Condition Toggling**: Select the type of bridge to form, such as "Left to Right", "Top to Bottom", and "Top-Left to Bottom-Right".
  * **Interactive Controls**: Sliders and input fields for setting the minimum/maximum line length and angle.
  * **Dynamic Simulation**: Watch lines being placed in real-time on an HTML canvas.
  * **State Controls**: Buttons to **Start**, **Stop/Pause**, and **Reset** the simulation.
  * **Live Data Output**: A display showing the current count of placed lines.
  * **Result Reporting**: A clear final report stating the number of lines required to form the bridge.
  * **Cluster Visualization**: All clusters of connected lines are rendered in unique colors, providing a rich, real-time view of the percolation process.
  * **(Optional) Highlighting**: The successful connecting path is highlighted in a distinct color upon completion.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

To ensure modularity and enable parallel development, the application will be broken down into four primary, decoupled modules:

1.  **UI Controller (`ui.js`)**: Handles all user interactions. It reads values from the input controls and dispatches events. It does *not* know how the simulation runs or how to draw on the canvas. It only manages the user-facing elements.
2.  **Simulation Engine (`engine.js`)**: The core logic of the simulation. It maintains the state (the list of lines, running status), generates new lines according to the specified parameters, and uses the helper modules to check for a connection. It is completely independent of the DOM and the canvas.
3.  **Rendering Engine (`renderer.js`)**: Responsible for all drawing on the HTML canvas. It takes the state from the Simulation Engine and visually represents it. It doesn't know how the state is generated; it only knows how to draw it.
4.  **Utility Modules (`utils.js`)**: A set of pure, standalone functions for performing complex calculations.
      * **Intersection Module**: A function to determine if two line segments intersect.
      * **Connectivity Module**: A `UnionFind` class and associated logic in the `SimulationEngine` to incrementally track connected components. It efficiently determines if a bridge exists without rebuilding a graph on every step.

This separation of concerns means a developer can work on the intersection logic without touching any UI code, or another can refine the canvas drawing without understanding the core simulation loop.

## üìù Development Task Breakdown

Here are the specific, modular tasks required to build the simulator. They are grouped by module to facilitate parallel work.

### Module 1: üßë‚Äçüíª Simulation Engine (`engine.js`)

*This is the brain of the application. It runs the simulation and manages all the data.*

  - [x] **Task 1.1: Initialize Simulation State**

      - **Description**: Create a function or class that initializes and holds the simulation's state.
      - **State should include**: `lines` (an array of line objects), `isRunning` (boolean), `lineCount` (number), `simulationParameters` (object containing length/angle ranges), and `canvasDimensions` (width, height).

  - [x] **Task 1.2: Implement the Main Simulation Loop**

      - **Description**: Create a `runStep()` function that executes a single step of the simulation. This involves generating one line, adding it to the state, and then checking for a connection.
      - **Logic**:
        1.  Call the line generation function (Task 1.3).
        2.  Add the new line to the `lines` array.
        3.  Increment `lineCount`.
        4.  Call the connectivity checker (Task 4.2).
        5.  If a connection is found, set `isRunning` to `false`.

  - [x] **Task 1.3: Develop Random Line Generation Logic**

      - **Description**: Create a function that generates a new line object based on the current parameters. A key challenge is ensuring the *entire* line is within the canvas boundaries.
      - **Input**: `simulationParameters`, `canvasDimensions`.
      - **Output**: A line object, e.g., `{ x1, y1, x2, y2 }`.

### Module 2: üé® User Interface & Controls (`ui.js`)

*This module connects the user to the simulation engine through DOM elements.*

  - [x] **Task 2.1: Build HTML Structure for Controls**

      - **Description**: Create the HTML for all user inputs and displays.
      - **Elements**:
          - Sliders/number inputs for min/max line length.
          - Sliders/number inputs for min/max line angle (0-360 degrees).
          - "Start," "Pause," and "Reset" buttons.
          - A display area for the current line count.
          - A display area for the final result message.

  - [x] **Task 2.2: Implement Control Event Listeners**

      - **Description**: Write the JavaScript to handle user interactions. When a user clicks a button or changes a slider, this module will call the appropriate function in the Simulation Engine.
      - **Example**: The "Start" button's event listener should trigger a function that sets `engine.isRunning` to `true` and repeatedly calls `engine.runStep()`. The "Reset" button should call a function that clears the engine's state.

### Module 3: üñºÔ∏è Rendering Engine (`renderer.js`)

*This module is solely responsible for drawing. It is a "dumb" component that just visualizes the data it's given.*

  - [x] **Task 3.1: Set Up the Canvas**

      - **Description**: Create a function to initialize the HTML `<canvas>` element, setting its dimensions and getting its 2D drawing context.

  - [x] **Task 3.2: Create a Line Drawing Function**

      - **Description**: Write a simple function that takes a line object (`{ x1, y1, x2, y2 }`) and a color, and draws it on the canvas.

  - [x] **Task 3.3: Implement the Main Render Function**

      - **Description**: Create a `render()` function that draws the entire simulation state.
      - **Logic**:
        1.  Clear the canvas completely.
        2.  Draw the rectangular boundary/background.
        3.  Loop through the `engine.state.lines` array and use the line drawing function (Task 3.2) to draw each one.

  - [x] **Task 3.4 (Stretch Goal): Implement Path Highlighting**

      - **Description**: After the simulation completes, the Connectivity Module (Task 4.2) should be able to return the specific lines that form the bridge. Create a function in the renderer to re-draw just those lines in a different color (e.g., bright red).

### Module 4: üîß Utility Modules (`utils.js`)

*These are pure, mathematical functions that can be developed and tested in complete isolation.*

  - [x] **Task 4.1: Implement Line Segment Intersection Logic**

      - **Description**: Write a function that determines if two line segments intersect. This is a classic computational geometry problem.
      - **Input**: Two line objects, e.g., `intersects(lineA, lineB)`.
      - **Output**: `true` or `false`.
      - **Note**: This function must be robust and handle all edge cases (collinear, touching at an endpoint, etc.).

  - [x] **Task 4.2: Develop the Graph Connectivity Algorithm**

      - **Description**: The simulation uses a highly efficient incremental algorithm to check for a bridge.
      - **Input**: A new line and the existing set of lines.
      - **Output**: A boolean indicating if a bridge has just been formed.
      - **High-Level Logic**:
        1.  A `UnionFind` data structure maintains sets of connected lines.
        2.  When a new line is added, it is checked for intersections with existing lines.
        3.  For each intersection, the `union` operation merges the sets of the two lines.
        4.  A bridge is formed if a line touching the start boundary is found to be in the same set as a line touching the end boundary.
        5.  This avoids rebuilding the entire graph and provides a significant performance improvement.

## üî¨ Opportunities for Future Development

This project provides a solid foundation for exploring percolation theory, but there are many opportunities for enhancement and further development. The following suggestions are grouped by category.

### **Performance Optimizations**

*   **Incremental Connectivity Checks**: The simulation has been optimized to avoid re-calculating the entire intersection graph at every step. Instead of an O(n¬≤) check, it now uses an efficient incremental approach.
    *   **Union-Find Data Structure**: The core of the optimization is a **Union-Find** (or Disjoint Set Union) data structure. Each line is a member of a set. When a new line is added, it's only checked for intersections against *existing* lines. When an intersection occurs, the sets of the two lines are merged. A bridge is formed the moment any line touching the starting boundary belongs to the same set as a line touching the finishing boundary. This makes the check nearly constant time on average for each new line.
    *   **Quadtrees**: For a very large number of lines, the intersection detection itself can be optimized by using a spatial partitioning data structure like a Quadtree. This would allow the simulation to quickly find which lines are near a new line, avoiding the need to check against every other line on the canvas.

### **Code Refinements & Robustness**

*   **Efficient Line Generation**: The `_generateRandomLine` method in `engine.js` uses a `while` loop that could be slow if the line length parameters are large relative to the canvas size. A more robust approach would be to first pick a random point *within a margin* of the canvas, then calculate the valid range of angles that would keep the line in-bounds, and finally pick a random angle from that valid range.
*   **Input Validation**: The UI in `index.html` and `ui.js` should be updated to include input validation. For example, prevent the minimum length from being greater than the maximum length.
*   **Dependency Management**: For a larger project, explicitly list dependencies (even if just for testing, like Node.js) and consider using a package manager like npm to manage them.

### **Advanced Simulation Features**

*   **Data Logging and Analysis**: Run the simulation multiple times automatically ("headless" mode) with a given set of parameters. Log the number of lines required for each run and calculate statistics like the mean, median, and variance. This would allow for a more rigorous exploration of the percolation threshold.
*   **Different Element Shapes**: Modify the simulation to use other shapes instead of lines, such as circles, squares, or ellipses, to see how the geometry of the elements affects the percolation threshold.
*   **Configurable Bridge Area**: Allow the user to resize or move the "bridge area" dynamically to explore how its dimensions affect the results.

### **Expanded Testing**

*   **UI & Engine Tests**: While more complex, adding basic tests for the UI (e.g., ensuring button clicks trigger the right engine functions) and the `SimulationEngine` state machine would improve reliability. Frameworks like Jest (with JSDOM) could be used for this.
